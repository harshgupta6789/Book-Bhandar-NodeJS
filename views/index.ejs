           Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
       </div>
       <div class="headtext">
           It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

            <h1><i>The Secret by Rhonda Byrne<i></h1>
            <p>I liked the concept of the book. It is based on Law of Attraction. 
            Law of Attraction is NOT TRUE (in fact, it is not even a law), however, believing in it “simplifies our life” as it allows us:
            > to imagine that if we are working hard, then, results gonna be positive.
            > to chase our dreams (which often times is UNPRACTICAL to follow, hence, we do need “some hope/false faith” to at least put our best of the best efforts to realise our dreams).
            One can take lightly the some of the things mentioned in the book, sending right/positive vibrations to the Universe, letting the Universe know what you want, etc.

            <h1><i>A Tale of two cities by Charles Dickens<i></h1>
            <p>It's about the French Revolution. The "two cities" refers literally to France and England, but it may also be a metaphor for the two main characters of the book. 
            It shows the distinctions of social class and its effects on society and dwells on the complexities of human nature and human experiences.
             Here's a more complete and accurate guide http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/twocities
            The Tale is coincidentally a historical fiction novel. 
            At the time of writing, Dickens sought current civil settings, sometimes quoting actual events of the revolution, to vent his libelous conceptualization of humanity.

            <h1><i>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen<i></h1>
            <p>Because it's an honest observation of people's characters in the Regency era that we can still relate (well, some part of it), and it's witty too.
            I've read it a few times, and I realize that, as I grow older, I had a different perception towards the matters in the book each time I read it.
            We all do have “mental barriers” (that's why we say I can't do that, it's not possible for me) and these barriers even stop us from taking the first step. This is where the concept of “The Secret” book could be utilised. First we have to prepare ourselves mentally for our goals (asking the Universe/God for it), then when we have to take proper actions.
            Therefore, it's never a bore, unlike many other classic lits. I believe the book is even able to lift my mood

           <h1><i>Resurrection by Leo Tolstoy
            <i></h1>
            <p>
            Start with his long short story, “The Death of Ivan Illich.” 
            Personally, I am not a Tolstoy fan. 
            I find his prose turgid and pretentious.
             We all do have “mental barriers” (that's why we say I can't do that, it's not possible for me) and these barriers even stop us from taking the first step. This is where the concept of “The Secret” book could be utilised. First we have to prepare ourselves mentally for our goals (asking the Universe/God for it), then when we have to take proper actions. Results will appear, sooner or later. 
            Something good will come out of it (may not be exactly what we wanted).
             Try Dostoevsky instead, starting with CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.
